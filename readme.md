This repo is an Angular implementation of this Full Stack React + GraphQL tutorial by Jonas Hefler and the Apollo team: https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/full-stack-react-graphql-tutorial-582ac8d24e3b

To view Apollo Subscription functionality:
- open localhost in two separate browser windows and go to the same channel in both windows
- add a new message in one browser and watch for it to appear in the other

ToDo: add Apollo Subscription functionality around AddChannel mutation.
